# Rhymebook Chakra
The API powered notebook that writes your rhymes (and much more) with you!

## About the Project
Rhymebook is a free notetaking service that functions similar to Google Keep or Evernote with additional features. We utilize the [Datamuse API](https://www.datamuse.com/api/) to find rhymes, sound alikes, adjectives, nouns, related words, frequent followers, synonyms, and antonyms based upon the most recent term input by the user.
